                                                                Once upon a time, I took the first step on my programming journey with <span class="base-color">Java</span>. Through some university classes combining self-education, I then explored various Java technologies, most notably <span class="base-color">Spring frameworks</span>, for the development of enterprise & desktop software or back-end of web applications. I also slightly expanded my experiences learning a few web technologies for front-end development and built some of personal-fun-things.
                                                                <br>

                                                                While normal software is all about services to serve our life, <span class="base-color">computer graphics</span> (CG) is the technology enabling us to create life itself, virtually. That interests me, Particularly, game development is a subset of CG, where we define our own rules for the world then allow players to get involved in. That interests me more.
                                                                <br>
                                                                I first got started in this field by playing around with a few CG and game tools. Feeling more and more engaged, I decided to pick <span class="base-color">Unity</span> and <span class="base-color"> Unreal Engine</span> as my "long-term companions" on the journey.
                                                                <br>
                                                                Since then, I have been constantly horning my skills by registering for online courses, reading fundamental books, following bite-sized tutorials, solving coding problems, working on personal projects collaborative coding laboratories for my classes which involve with CG or game.
                                                                While mainly focusing on <span class="base-color">gameplay programming</span>, I enjoy every other aspect in the development process as well. I particularly fall in love with <span class="base-color">procedural generation</span>, <span class="base-color">open world</span> and <span class="base-color">3D</span> game genres.
